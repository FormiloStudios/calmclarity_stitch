                    Why I Started Calm Clarity
                </h2>
                <div className="space-y-8 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted font-light">
                    <p>
                        In a world that prizes noise over nuance, I found myself searching for
                        a space that offered both sophistication and substance. Calm Clarity
                        was born out of a personal necessity to bridge the gap between
                        high-end lifestyle curation and genuine, science-backed wellness.

                        The journey wasn&#39;t immediate. It took years of exploring the
                        intersections of mindfulness, nutritional science, and aesthetic
                        living to realize that true wellness isn&#39;t just a practice—it&#39;s
                        an art form. I wanted to create a platform that respects the
                        reader&#39;s intelligence while providing a sanctuary from the
                        digital chaos.
